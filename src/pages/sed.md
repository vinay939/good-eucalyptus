Technology risks :

If we develop our website or an app on a development platform and if some other development platforms suddenly take a major chunk of a market, then we have to  develop on that platform and this would cost our company more money and would even cross our threshold this could be a major risk.

Data privacy may also be a problem. We should ensure to keep the data of the

customer safe for their security.

Market Risk:

There is a huge competition in the travel business in the market, So there may be a

company which would come with a similar idea this may take a major part of our market and this would lead to a major loss and other risks would be if we collaborate with some airline companies or hotels and if these companies get into a trouble or if they get bankrupt and these factors may show effect on our venture.

Team Risk:

We may also face a major risk by our team members because they may leave our company once they get a better opportunity in a good company or better pay, So they may be a major risk for our company because they will know what our company is exactly working on and there may chance of major data leak.

Regulation and legal uncertainties:

 New government regulations may also be a major risk for the company and the most major problem faced by government policies is uncertainty in international travels. If there is a problem between any two countries then the total travel connections between these two countries will get stopped.

Financial risk:

There are some major financial risks in our venture, we primarily make money from internet handling fees for booking tickets online and another source is commissioning from airline companies and hotels which make a major percentage of profit. So there may be major problems like airline decommissioning which may cut a major part of our income and this is already effective in countries like united states, So this type of problem will reduce our profits drastically.
